            <p>Hi! My name is Karonech (Ka-ro-nec), but you can call me KC. I’m a professional photographer operating in Austin and the Central Texas area (Georgetown, Jarrel, Hutto)</p>
            <p>When I began falling in love with photography five years ago, I found one aspect drew me to the medium above all: the power to show people the beauty I see in them.</p>
            <p>I believe photography is about more than just taking nice pictures. It’s paramount to me that your true and beautiful self come out with confidence, warmth, and love.</p>

            <p>Photos are truly unique memory pieces that allow you years from now to look back and visually remember your experience. Sometimes in all the commotion, liveliness, and excitement of the event itself, it’s the photos that let you take it all in afterward.</p>
            <p>An incredible amount of planning and care goes into your wedding, and your photography should be no different. I work alongside you to iron out details around your schedule, location, wardrobe, and event plan to ensure the vision of your wedding is captured, and everything goes off without a hitch (except for the one where you get married!).</p>
            <p>I don’t set a minimum or maximum on the number of final photos from a session, instead completely focusing on careful selection and development of the best ones that tell the full story of your wedding. I keep a small footprint for efficiency and intimacy and do everything I can to keep rates affordable. I want to provide everyone I can with truly beautiful, authentic photos of this once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
